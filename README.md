Expense Tracker – Mini Budget App

Project Description
This is a simple Expense Tracker made with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It lets you add, edit, delete, and view your daily expenses. You can also filter your expenses by category, sort them in different ways, and see a small bar chart that shows how much money you spent in each category.
